Met with ECEB shop supervisor Greg on the morning of Sept 17, 2024. We asked him questions regarding the mechanics of: 

  1) How to squirt a specific amount of nutrients into the water. 
  2) How to get the solenoid valves working for the water changing/drainage. 

Here is what Greg said about the nutrient injection: 

  - Use a weed sprayer. Specifically a Craftsman Batteru Powered Sprayer Wand
  - This wand can be deconstructed to only contain what we need (the sprayer part).

Here is what Greg said about the solenoid valve ideas: 

  - He said that they were a bad idea. There is a possibility of leaks, and all canisters would have to be connected together (would be hard to move). 
  - He said to use a sump pump instead. Gavin is going to look for one that we can use.
